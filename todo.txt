*?make the render behave more smartly, only update the table classes, don't generate a new table

-add a readme

-make sure the simulation stops once it reaches a steady state

-make the parameterization and initialization more user friendly

*fix bug in simulation, agents who shouldnt be happy are being counted as happy
???is this true??? Why hou??

*encapsulate the global variables in rendering.js

*involve angular.js in the mix, maybe as a separate branch, save vanialla as separate branch?

*try to use inheritance to make a similar simulation with slightly different rules, game of life?


DONE
