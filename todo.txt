**https://medium.com/kr-projects/d32c46e9e4a5

*make a separate object to keep track of the agents
**assume JSON is the way to do that

*make a render function ot take the agents objects and display it on the table

*make a continuing animation that cycles through one agent at a time and moves it to a new location

*style the table cells to have less wasted space
